			<h2>Choice 1: Panda Express</h2>
			<p> Panda Express is a great place to get Chinese food that is both good and fast. My personal favorite is the orange chicken and broccoli beef. Their rice is great, and you can never go wrong with a crab rangoon. </p>
			
			<h2>Choice 2: Wendy's</h2>
			<p> Wendy's is home to one of the best fast food bacon burgers out there. Their square patties bring something unique and inventful to the fast food industry, and the quality of their burgers never fails to surprise me. </p>
			
			<h2>Choice 3: Five Guys</h2>
			<p> Five Guys is another really solid place to get good bacon burgers. It is exciting to see them make your burgur right in front of you, and the possibiliites for customization are endless. They also have some of the best shakes I've ever had at a fast food place, and you can even get bacon in your shakes! </p>
			
			<h2>Choice 4: In-N-Out Burger</h2>
			<p> While I've only been to In-N-Out Burger a select number of times, there's no way I couldn't have included it in my favorites. With not that many location accross the United States, every visit is a special experience. The place is always crowded with customers because everyone wants a taste of such a classic burger.   </p>
			
			<h2>Choice 5: Runza</h2>
			<p> I couldn't live in Nebraska and not include Runza in my top five. Not only does Runza represent that Nebraskan pride, but their unique food they serve puts them ahead of a lot of other places. It's not everywhere that you can get the classic cheese Runza or those wavy curly fries, and that's what I think keeps me coming back for more.  </p>
